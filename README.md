briite | A WordPress theme
===

briite is a lightweight WordPress theme design for online portfolio presentation. briite was built on the Automattic _s framework.
This ultra-lightweight theme was built with minimal third party libraries making it light and quick. Here are some of the other more interesting things you'll find here:
•	A just right amount of lean, well-commented, modern, HTML5 templates.
•	A helpful 404 template.
•	Some small tweaks in inc/extras.php that can improve your theming experience.
•	Licensed under GPLv2 or later. :) Use it to make something cool.
